            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ (listen); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist 
                and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied 
                physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research 
                and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space 
                programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development 
                of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's
                Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]Kalam was elected as the 11th president of 
                India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to 
                as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient
                of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

            <h2><i>Biography</i></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Kalam’s career as a scientist began in earnest in 1965 when he joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).</li>
                <li>In 1969, APJ Abdul Kalam was transferred to the Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) in Hyderabad, where he worked on the development of India’s first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III).</li>
                <li>The SLV-III was a remarkable achievement for India, as it made India the sixth country in the world to have a satellite launch capability.</li>
                <li>Kalam’s biggest achievement, however, came in 1983 when he became the director of the DRDO’s Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP).</li>
                <li>Under his leadership, the programme developed five missile systems, including the Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Nag, and Trishul missiles.</li>
                <li>These missiles were significant for India as they gave the country a credible deterrent against its neighbors, particularly Pakistan and China.</li>
                <li>APJ Abdul Kalam was widely recognized as the “Missile Man of India” for his role in developing these missile systems.... </li>
